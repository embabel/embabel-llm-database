  "description": "MedGemma is a collection of Gemma 3 variants that are trained for performance on medical text and image comprehension. MedGemma 4B utilizes a SigLIP image encoder that has been specifically pre-trained on a variety of de-identified medical data, including chest X-rays, dermatology images, ophthalmology images, and histopathology slides. Its LLM component is trained on a diverse set of medical data, including radiology images, histopathology patches, ophthalmology images, and dermatology images. MedGemma is a multimodal model primarily evaluated on single-image tasks. It has not been evaluated for multi-turn applications and may be more sensitive to specific prompts than its predecessor, Gemma 3. Developers should consider bias in validation data and data contamination concerns when using MedGemma.",
