  "description": "Gemma 3n is a generative AI model optimized for use in everyday devices, such as phones, laptops, and tablets. It features innovations like Per-Layer Embedding (PLE) parameter caching and a MatFormer model architecture for reduced compute and memory. These models handle audio, text, and visual data, though this E4B preview currently supports text and vision input. Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models, and is licensed for responsible commercial use.",
