  "description": "Phi-4-mini-reasoning is designed for multi-step, logic-intensive mathematical problem-solving tasks under memory/compute constrained environments and latency bound scenarios. Some of the use cases include formal proof generation, symbolic computation, advanced word problems, and a wide range of mathematical reasoning scenarios. These models excel at maintaining context across steps, applying structured logic, and delivering accurate, reliable solutions in domains that require deep analytical thinking.",
