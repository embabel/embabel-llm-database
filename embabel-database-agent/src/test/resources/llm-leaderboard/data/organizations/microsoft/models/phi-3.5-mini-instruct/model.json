  "description": "Phi-3.5-mini-instruct is a 3.8B-parameter model that supports up to 128K context tokens, with improved multilingual capabilities across over 20 languages. It underwent additional training and safety post-training to enhance instruction-following, reasoning, math, and code generation. Ideal for environments with memory or latency constraints, it uses an MIT license.",
