  "description": "Devstral Small 1.1 (also called devstral-small-2507) is based on the Mistral-Small-3.1 foundation model and contains approximately 24 billion parameters. It supports a 128k token context window, which allows it to handle multi-file code inputs and long prompts typical in software engineering workflows. The model is fine-tuned specifically for structured outputs, including XML and function-calling formats. This makes it compatible with agent frameworks such as OpenHands and suitable for tasks like program navigation, multi-step edits, and code search. It is licensed under Apache 2.0 and available for both research and commercial use.",
