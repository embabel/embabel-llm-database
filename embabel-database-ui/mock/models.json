Unlike Grok 3, tool usage is built into the training process rather than relying on generalization. Trained using 200,000 GPUs, Grok 4 excels at complex reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and coding tasks, though it has acknowledged weaknesses in multimodal capabilities that are being addressed in the next version."},{"name":"Grok-3","id":"grok-3","tags":["image-text-to-text"],"knowledgeCutoff":"2024-11-17","releaseDate":"2025-02-17","parameterCount":0,"organization":{"id":"xai","name":"xAI","website":"https://x.ai"},"multiModal":true,"modelProviders":[{"id":"grok-3","provider":{"id":"xai","name":"xAI","website":"https://docs.x.ai"},"inputPerMillion":3.0,"outputPerMillion":15.0,"tags":[],"deprecated":false}],"description":"Grok 3, launched by xAI on February 17, 2025, is an advanced AI model with significantly enhanced capabilities compared to Grok 2, boasting an order of magnitude increase in performance.
